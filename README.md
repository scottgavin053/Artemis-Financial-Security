# Artemis-Financial-Security

## Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
The client was Artemis Financial. They are a financial consulting company in charge of developing custom financial plans for clients. The issues they wanted to address included providing security to their pre-existing web interface.
## What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was determining whether a vulnerability was a false positive. When going through each of them, you have to determine whether the versions affected apply to the project.
## How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
By adding an encryption algorithm cipher, self-signed certificate generation, and secure communications, we were able to add multiple layers of security to help deter attackers.
## How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
By running the vulnerability check before and after refactoring the code, we can check to see if any new dependencies were introduced. If so, then we can proceed to try and find a solution for them.
## What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The dependency check is definitely something that I could use in future projects to limit vulnerabilities and possible unforeseen consequences.
## Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
For this particular assignment, continuous improvement and added functionality seem to be some of the major takeaways. We added multiple layers of security to an existing application. There is also plenty of opportunity to expand on security even further.
